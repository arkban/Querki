 * The "common" names used in Querki.

 * This is a bit of a hack, for letting the client and server share info about the major
 * API objects. These objects are listed in StandardThings, which connects the two sides
 * by Link Name. In order to not duplicate strings, the actual server objects use this
 * structure to fetch the official names from here.
 *
 * The result is a tad clumsy, but strongly-typed and not duplicative. For example, the name of the
 * QList Collection is:
 *
 * import querki.api.commonName
 * ...
 * commonName(_.core.listColl)
