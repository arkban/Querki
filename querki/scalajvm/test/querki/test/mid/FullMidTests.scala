/**
 * This is the primary mid-level test suite. It wraps up tons of other tests into a single run,
 * including the main regression tests. This is mainly for speed: we want to minimize the number
 * of times that we have to start and stop the engine.
 *
 * The individual components of this should generally have their own tests, usually marked as
 * @Slow, so that we can test them individually.
 *
 * Note that, unlike the full Functional Tests, this one doesn't work nearly as hard to maintain
 * a consistent sense of "current client state", since we mostly don't care -- at the API level,
 * it is totally straightforward to have a lot of separate sessions going.
