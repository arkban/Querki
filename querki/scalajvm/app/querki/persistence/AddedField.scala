/**
 * Wrapper type, for fields that get added to an Event that has already been serialized
 * into the database.
 *
 * This is a challenging situation, because deserializing old Events will leave this field
 * null. So in order to deal with that, we have this hand-crafted type, which doesn't expose
 * any concrete methods but instead provides a couple of safe methods through an implicit
 * pimped class.
 *
 * AddedField itself is simply an empty marker trait -- the actual contents are held in the private
 * AddedFieldImpl. That's intentional, so that you can't accidentally get a hold of the contents
 * directly.
 *
 * Access to an AddedField is, thus, intentionally limited -- you can only use the functions that
 * are defined in AddedField.AddedFieldMethods. But it's null-safe, and thus works for schema evolution.
