 * Note that these versions are intentionally stripped-down. For example, they don't contain the Space ID,
 * because that's redundant for our purposes: the message is being persisted in this Space's archive. They
 * turn out not to quite match the public messages, and that's deliberate: the fields being persisted are
 * the ones that are there after we do all the checks, which are needed to make the real state changes.
