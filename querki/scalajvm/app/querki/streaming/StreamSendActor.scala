/**
 * This is a simplistic Actor, used to implement the sending side of our reliable streaming protocol. Neither
 * ask nor request are sufficient to the task, because managing possible duplication gets hairy in an
 * exactly-once protocol such as we need here.
 *
 * Note an important assumption: since the StreamSendActor is created *locally* to the Controller, so
 * asks from the Controller to this Actor are adequately reliable.
 *
 * The caller of this sender should be creating it locally, and using ask() to send it ByteStrings. It must
 * wait until it receives an UploadChunkAck before sending the next, and should have a timeout of at least four
 * times the timeout of the retry in here.
 *
 * TODO: this needs unit testing!
 *
 * @param recipient An UploadActor that will be receiving the stream.
